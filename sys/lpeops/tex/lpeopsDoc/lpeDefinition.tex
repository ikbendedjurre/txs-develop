\chapter{LPE}

\section{Introduction}
The techniques that are described in the following chapters must be applied to a \emph{linear process equation}, or LPE for short.

\section{Requirements}

An LPE must satisfy the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item Given are the definition of a single process \emph{and} its instantiation.
The instantiation must be a closed expression, and otherwise satisfy the usual requirements of \txs{} of process instantiations.
There are no requirements for the channel parameters and data parameters beyond the usual requirements of \txs{} of process definitions.

\item The body of the process consists of one or more \emph{summands}.
In this context, a summand must contain exactly the following, in the given order:

\begin{itemize}

\item One or more \emph{channel communications}; that is, channel references followed by the variables that are used to communicate over those channels.
For example, \inlinecode{OUTPUT ? x ? y}, or simply \inlinecode{OUTPUT}.

Channel communications are combined with \inlinecode{|}.
To give another example, \inlinecode{INPUT ? x | OUTPUT ? y}.

The variables that are used to communicate over a channel must be \emph{fresh}.

\item A guard, yielding a boolean value.
The guard is not always explicitly written if it is semantically equivalent to \inlinecode{true}.

\item A sequence operator, \inlinecode{>->}.

\item The expression for deadlock (\inlinecode{STOP}) \emph{or} a recursive process instantiation.
The instantiated process must use the process definition given by the LPE, which satisfies the requirements of a \txs{} process signature.
This includes channel parameters: these must be assigned their current values of the instantiating process.
There are no requirements for the values assigned to the data parameters beyond the usual requirements of \txs{} (such as type compatibility).

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Example}

The following code snippet gives a valid example of an LPE:

\begin{lstlisting}
//Process definition:
PROCDEF example[A :: Int, B](state, curr, prev :: Int)
  = A ? i [[state==0]] >-> example[A, B](2, i, prev)
  + A ? i [[state==1 && i!=prev]] >-> example[A, B](2, i, prev)
  + A ? i [[state==2 && i==curr]] >-> example[A, B](1, curr, curr)
  + B >-> STOP
  ;

//Initialization:
example[A, B](0, 0, 0);
\end{lstlisting}

The process only accepts input sequences in which every number is repeated exactly once.
The process terminates non-deterministically.
